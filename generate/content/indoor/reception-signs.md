What perception does your reception area or foyer give to your clients? Are you projecting the corporate image and quality branding that you think you are?
Signage in your reception and foyer is viewed at close range, so a combination of specialized techniques, excellent finish, and materials are important elements of the design. Remember, you want to stage a lasting appeal that stays with a person long after they have left your premises.
